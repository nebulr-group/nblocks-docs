# Users & Tenants
Every time we've started a new SaaS project before we've seen the following needs for security and user management:
* Our customers' data needs to be organized in workspaces.
* The workspace data should be easily distinguished in the database so we can build filters and accomplish data separation.
* Users need to be able to login and be granted a set of predefined privilegues.
* Users should be able to invite other users to the same workspace.
* Some users would like to get access to several workspaces but still use the same credentials and one login.
* Same user might be granted different privileges for different workspaces.

We then sat down with all the learnings and created something flexible for you to use.
We decided to name workspaces as **tenants** from the well known data separation architecture [Multitenancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy).
You'll not need to store any user or tenant data yourself.

:::note
This is a central concept of Nblocks and defines how you can expect the data to be organized.

## Tenants
A tenant represents a **workspace** of a customer and encapsulates all its users and other data for that workspace. 
The tenant contains information about the current subscription plan which can be used to render a specific feature set and other fields like locale which can be used to render translation resources. 
Other data could be files in the file storage etc. Many calls that you make to Nblocks require you to provide an identification for the tenant context for this purpose.

Tenants get created automatically in Nblocks if you've opted in for our [checkout solution](stripe). 
There's also the option for you to manage this yourself and programatically create new tenants. Be aware that Nblocks will not monitor payments and automatically provision access to your app for manual tenants.

Here's an example of data that is made available to your app via the Tenant object:

| Variable          | Description |
| -----------       | ----------- |
| id                | Unique ID |
| name              | Name of the tenant. Not set from the beginning until the Tenant owner complets tenant onboarding. |
| plan              | Name of the subscription plan. Automatically set by the payment service if tenant used the checkout process |
| locale            | The default locale / lang code for all users in this tenant (`ISO_639-1` format). This property will set the i18n for all platform emails and can be used to  |
| logo              | Url to a public accessible logo |
| metadata          | Store app specific meta data for this tenant |
| createdAt         | A public url to a terms of service. Used in email footers etc.  |

Removing a tenant will also remove all of its data. This comes in handy because in the age of privacy protection your tenants own their data.

:::tip
A common solution is to add the tenant id on each database entry so that you can easily separate and filter data based on what tenant the current user belongs to. 
This will enable you to accomplish data separation when serving multiple users.

## Users
A user represents an individual and his/her access to specific tenants and therefore your application. The same user can be added to several tenants and still use the same credentials as before. After login, the user will be able to select what tenant to access.

The user object contains personal information as well as other valuable fields for your use.
Here's an example of data that is made available to your app via the User object:

| Variable          | Description |
| -----------       | ----------- |
| id                | Unique ID |
| role              | Role of the user. Grants a set of privileges. Privileges are configured on the `App` model. See [security](security).|
| email             | Email address |
| username          | Username to login as, currently same as email address  |
| fullName          | Users full name (first name and last name concatenated) |
| onboarded         | If the user is onboarded or not (should be put through onboarding after first login) |
| enabled           | If the user should be allowed to login or not. Changeable via user management view |
| teams             | Array of identifiers that can be used to group several users into teams or groups  |
| tenant            | A nested Tenant object  |
| createdAt         | Date when the user was created  |

## Onboarding
1. A new tenant always creates a user with the role `OWNER`. This gives the user the grant to change name, locale and manage the subscription (if using payment service) for the tenant using the nblocks-plugins provided views.
1. The new tenant owner user will receive an email containing an onboarding link to your app.
1. The onboarding link will guide the user through an initial set password process or redirect straight to login if the user already existed in another tenant.
1. After login, each subsequent call the user makes to your api will contain resolved security data about a new tenant and its user. It's now up to you to render data and a response to these requests.
