# Quickstart User login
Integrate with Nblocks hosted login in any stack and have your users authenticate in no time. You can do this in your frontend or backend. You will apply a few lines of code using redirects using the familiar Open Id Connect, and OAuth2 flows.

After you're done with this guide your application will have a login flow with sign in, sign up, and SSO. 

:::info Prerequisites

1. You have [signed up](/docs/getting-started/signup) for Nblocks and have access to your [app id](/docs/getting-started/id-and-keys) 
1. You have a web project in any stack that can run on http://localhost:8080

:::tip Code examples

You can view example projects using the code from this guide [here](/docs/getting-started/example-projects).

:::

## Step 1: Open your project code base
Open your project source code in any editor of your choice.

## Step 2: Redirect the user to Nblocks Login
The idea is that your app should navigate user to Nblocks Login. 

### Add a login route
Add a new route in your app and redirect your user to the Nblocks Login entrypoint.
Below are pseudo code depending if you're implementing this for a frontend or backend.

#### Pseudo code
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="frontend" label="Frontend" default>

```ts
var APP_ID = "XXX";
window.location.href = `https://auth-stage.nblocks.cloud/url/login/${APP_ID}`;

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="backend" label="Backend" default>

```ts
var APP_ID = "XXX";
router.get("/login", (req, res) => {
    res.redirect(`https://auth-stage.nblocks.cloud/url/login/${APP_ID}`)
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip

We're using the `/authorize` endpoint here. For more details see the [API reference](https://nebulr-group.github.io/nblocks-api-docs/#short-hand-authorize)

:::

That's enough for this step. The user will be redirected away from your app and we can proceed to next step.

## Step 3: Recieve the user back
When the user completes authentication with Nblocks login, the user is redirected back to your app with a code that we will resolve into something more useful.
The URL looks like this: 
`http://localhost:8080/auth/oauth-callback?code=eyJh....`

### Add a callback route
Add a new route in your app that act as a handler when the user is returned. Your code must be able to retrieve the code parameter from the URL. 

#### Pseudo code
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="frontend" label="Frontend" default>

```ts
var code = (new URL(window.location.href)).searchParams.get('code');
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="backend" label="Backend" default>

```ts
router.get("/auth/oauth-callback", (req, res) => {
    var code = req.query.code;
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Exchange the code for tokens
With the code now successfully obtained we can exchange it for some more useful profile information. 
Your app should make a API call to make this exchange. 
The returning response contains secure token data and a resolved user profile which you can print to the console or display on your frontend page.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="rest" label="Rest" default>

Request
```ts
POST https://auth-stage.nblocks.cloud/token/code/APP_ID
```

Response
```json
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJQ...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJQ...",
  "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJQ...",
  "user_profile": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "family_name": "Doe",
    "given_name": "John",
    ...
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="js" label="JS" default>

```ts
const APP_ID = "XXXX";
const code = "XXXX";
const result = await fetch(`https://auth-stage.nblocks.cloud/token/code/${APP_ID}`,
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      code: code,
    }),
  }
).then(res => res.json());

// Print the user info
console.log(result.user_profile);
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::tip

We're using the `/token` endpoint here. For more details see the [API reference](https://nebulr-group.github.io/nblocks-api-docs/#shorthand-get-tokens)

That was all that was needed from you. We can now see this in action and test it.

## Try it!

### Start your app

### Navigate to /login

### Get redirected to Nblocks Login
Here we show how nice it looks. Youtube? Images? etc.

The user signs up or logs in.

### Get back to your app as a logged in user

## Next steps
Nblocks has a lot to offer. Here's some ideas on what to try next.
- Add SSO alternatives to your login experience
- Understand the mechanics of user tokens and how you can trust them in your app.
- Protect your frontend and backend with these tokens.
- Add Nblocks user management self service views to your app.
- Look at the checklist before going live.
