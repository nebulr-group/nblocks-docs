# Quickstart

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Overview

The following guide will get you up and running as quickly as possible by covering the following 3 steps:

1. Install the Nblocks plugins for both Backend and Frontend.
1. Run our provided scripts to bootstrap your project with an initial scaffolding and other dependencies. During this phase you'll be able to signup directly.
1. Testing the result and doing a small branding excercise üòâ

:::note

This quickstart requires you to have `npm` installed.

:::

Lets go! üöÄ

## Getting Started
In this exercise we'll install **Nblocks** for both a frontent and a backend project to leverage the full plug-n-play experience and prebaked feature set.
At this moment we support React for the frontend project and NestJS for the backend.

### Backend
Start with installing the backend! Install our plugin containing the necessary endpoints to power the Nblocks loaded frontend.

During the backend setup; the scripts will let you choose to signup for your own app profile in the Nblocks world.

:::tip Don't have a project yet?

If you don't have a project yet you can create a new skeleton project for NestJS.   
`nest new my-backend`. Requires @nestjs/cli.

Or you can clone a working [example project](https://github.com/nebulr-group/nblocks-nestjs-example) with this plugin installed from our Github üòâ

<TabItem value="nestjs" label="NestJS" default>

:::note

We support both NestJS 7 & 8.

:::

1. Step into your NestJS project root and run the scaffolding script to install our nblocks-nestjs plugin and all it's dependencies..
```bash
npx @nebulr-group/nblocks-plugin-tool setup-nestjs
```

2. Import the NBlocksModule in your app.module.ts
```typescript title="src/app.module.ts"
...
// Import the NBlocksModule
import { NBlocksModule } from '@nebulr-group/nblocks-nestjs';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ...
    // Add the NBlocksModule in module imports 
    NBlocksModule
    ...
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

3. Enable CORS in your main.ts since the Frontend project will need that to query data.
```typescript title="src/main.ts"
...
async function bootstrap() {
  ...
  // Enable CORS Add this to enable CORS
  app.enableCors();
  ...
  await app.listen(3000);
}
...
```

4. Launch your Backend. 
```bash
npm run start:dev
``` 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Frontend
It's time for the Nblocks plugin to supercharge your frontend.
:::tip Don't have a project yet?

If you don't have a project yet you can create a new skeleton project for React.   
`npx create-react-app my-frontend --template typescript`.

Or you can clone a working [example project](https://github.com/nebulr-group/nblocks-react-example) with this plugin installed from our Github üòâ
:::
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="react" label="React" default>

:::note

We support React 18.

:::

1. Step into your React project root and run the scaffolding script to install our nblocks-react plugin and all it's dependencies.
```bash
npx @nebulr-group/nblocks-plugin-tool setup-react
```

2. Import the NblocksProvider and surround your top most App component in App.tsx.
```typescript title="src/App.tsx"
import { NblocksProvider, InstallationCompleteComponent } from "@nebulr-group/nblocks-react";
function App() {
  return (
    <NblocksProvider config={{ devMode: true }}>
      {/* Optional success component */}
      <InstallationCompleteComponent/> 
    </NblocksProvider>
  );
}

export default App; 
```

:::tip Whats Dev mode?
Setting `devMode: true` will configure the plugin with some sensible defaults. More on this later.
:::

3. Launch your Frontend.
```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
``` 
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip Why port 8080?
Both React and the backend are using port 3000 by default. Therefore we start React on another port.
:::

### Done! Everything is installed and set!

You are now set up, supercharged and ready to power your app with all that we have to offer. Enjoy prebuilt frontend views and full functionality for:

-> Tenancy   
-> Register & onboarding   
-> Login   
-> Access control   
-> User management   
-> Checkout and billing   

## Let's try it!

### Create your first user and login
1. Try access your app by navigating to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and you should see a login screen.
1. Click the Create new account button.
1. Signup with a new user.
1. Go to your email inbox, wait for the onboarding email to arrive and follow the instructions to set a password.
1. Login with your new credentials.
1. You're now logged in and your session is kept between page reloads, congrats!

**Here's a list of the build in views included in the frontend.**
- [http://localhost:8080/setup/config](http://localhost:8080/setup/config)
- [http://localhost:8080/setup/signup](http://localhost:8080/setup/signup)
- [http://localhost:8080/auth/login](http://localhost:8080/auth/login)
- [http://localhost:8080/auth/reset-password](http://localhost:8080/auth/reset-password)
- [http://localhost:8080/auth/set-password/token](http://localhost:8080/auth/set-password/token)
- [http://localhost:8080/auth/mfa/required](http://localhost:8080/auth/mfa/required)
- [http://localhost:8080/auth/mfa/recover](http://localhost:8080/auth/mfa/recover)
- [http://localhost:8080/auth/mfa/setup](http://localhost:8080/auth/mfa/setup)
- [http://localhost:8080/user/list](http://localhost:8080/user/list)
- [http://localhost:8080/auth/logout](http://localhost:8080/auth/logout)

### Try adding a second user
No fun without some friends ü§ô. You're going to use our user management view to add another user!

**Let's proceed!** üë®‚Äçüíª

1. If you're not logged in, login again.
1. Navigate your browser to `/user/list` as in [http://localhost:8080/user/list](http://localhost:8080/user/list) to see the User management screen.
<img
  src={require('./assets/user-list.png').default}
  alt="User list"
  className=""
/>
1. Click add user, enter an alternative email address to yourself and click invite.
1. Check your inbox for a new onboarding email and click the link to start and complete the onboarding process. 
(This is going to take you through the same step you just did yourself in the previous excercise.)
1. Login with your new user.
1. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/user/list](http://localhost:8080/user/list) and you should se both your users popping up.


**Mission completed!** ü•ä

### That's all for today folks!
Great job with the quickstart! Now your app has been supercharged with Nblocks üöÄ and we got so much to show you what's under the hood.
