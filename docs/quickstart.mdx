# Quickstart

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

export const GridContainer = ({children}) => (
  <div className="row">
    {children}
  </div>
);

export const GridChild = ({children}) => (
  <div className="column">
    {children}
  </div>
);

## Overview

The following guide will get you up and running as quickly as possible by covering the following 3 steps:

1. Install the Nblocks plugins for both Frontend and Backend.
1. Run our provided scripts to bootstrap your project with an initial scaffolding and other dependencies. During this phase you'll be able to signup directly.
1. View the result and query some data

:::note

This quickstart requires you to have `npm` installed.

:::

Lets go! 🚀

## Getting Started
In this exercise we'll install **Nblocks** for both a frontent and a backend project to leverage the full plug-n-play experience and prebaked feature set.
Pick whatever framework that suits your taste for each area.

During the backend setup; the scripts will let you choose to signup for your own app and have the new credentials resolve automatically or use our demo app playground which is shared across all testers.
If you choose to sign up, wait with clicking the onboard link until the guide says so.

:::tip

If you don't have a project yet you can create new skeleton projects for both NestJS and Ionic.   
`nest new my-backend` and `ionic start my-frontend blank --type=angular`.   
Requires `@nestjs/cli` and `@ionic/cli`

### Backend
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nestjs" label="NestJS" default>

1. Install plugin.
```bash
npm i @nebulr-group/nblocks-nestjs
```

2. Run scaffolding script and choose to sign up or use the demo app.
```bash
npx @nebulr-group/nblocks-nestjs setup
```

3. Import the NBlocksModule in your app.module.ts
```typescript title="src/app.module.ts"
import { NBlocksModule } from '@nebulr-group/nblocks-nestjs';

@Module({
  imports: [NBlocksModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

4. Enable CORS in your main.ts since the Frontend project will need that to query data.
```typescript title="src/main.ts"
...
async function bootstrap() {
  ...
  app.enableCors();
  ...
  await app.listen(3000);
}
...
```

4. Launch your Backend. 
```bash
npm run start:dev
``` 

:::note

We support both NestJS 7 & 8.

### Frontend
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ionic" label="Ionic" default>

1. Run scaffolding script to install all dependencies.
```bash
npx @nebulr-group/nblocks-plugin-tool setup-ionic
```

2. Include the Nblocks css styles and styles from PrimeNG peer dependencies under **app > architect > build > options** in the angular.json file located in your project root.
Usually this property sits around row 34.
```json title="angular.json"
...
"styles": [
  ...
  "node_modules/primeicons/primeicons.css",
  "node_modules/primeng/resources/themes/saga-blue/theme.css",
  "node_modules/primeng/resources/primeng.min.css",
  "node_modules/@nebulr-group/nblocks-ionic/styles/global.css"
],
...
```

3. Import the NblocksIonicModule in your app.module.ts.
```typescript title="src/app/app.module.ts"
import { NblocksIonicModule, AUTH_HTTP_INTERCEPTOR_PROVIDERS } from '@nebulr-group/nblocks-ionic';

@NgModule({
    declarations: [AppComponent],
    entryComponents: [],
    imports: [
      ...
        NblocksIonicModule.forRoot({})

    providers: [
        ...
        AUTH_HTTP_INTERCEPTOR_PROVIDERS
})
```

4. Launch your Frontend. 
```bash
ionic serve
``` 

:::note

We support Ionic 5 & 6 and Angular 10, 11, 12, 13.

## Let's see the result

### Logging in for the first time
1. Open up your web browser and navigate to your frontend project start screen. 
1. Append the current url with `/auth` like in `http://localhost:8100/auth` and hit enter. 
You should see your first glimpse of the Nblocks login screen 😎
1. If you choose to use the Demo app, login as `john.doe@example.com`, password `helloworld`. If you signed up straight in your console you have received an email to onboard your first user, click that link now and set your first password and login.
1. You're now logged in and your session is kept between page reloads, congrats!

### Try adding a user
Before we try to query sensitive data we must make sure that we've protected the backend endpoint so that the Nblocks guards will authorize and identify you.
This is achieved using the `resourceMappings.json` file which is read by the plugin during startup. 
:::note
Every time you change `resourceMappings.json`, a server restart is necessary for the changes to take effect.
:::
**Let's proceed!** 👨‍💻
1. 
Make all endpoints require the `USER_READ` privilege by adding this to the file and restart your backend server. 
```json title="nblocks/config/resourceMappings.json"
{
    "graphql/**": "USER_READ",
    "/**": "USER_READ"
}
```
2. Navigate your browser to `/user` as in `http://localhost:8100/user` to see the User management screen.
<img
  src={require('./assets/user-list.png').default}
  alt="User list"
  className="screenshot"
/>
3. Click add user, enter a valid email address and click invite.
4. Check your inbox for an email and click the link to start the onboarding process.
5. Mission completed! 🥊

### Querying data in backend
In this example, you'll code a small controller action that will render the current user list back.   
You'll be testing this by using your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000/nblocks-tenants`.
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nestjs" label="NestJS" default>

1. Open the up the AppController.ts and inject ClientService provider from '@nebulr-group/nblocks-nestjs';
```typescript title=src/app.controller.ts
import { ClientService } from '@nebulr-group/nblocks-nestjs';
...
constructor(
    private readonly clientService: ClientService
  ) {}
```

2. Add a new controller action for `nblocks-tenants` path.
```typescript title=src/app.controller.ts
@Get('nblocks-tenants')
async nblocksTenants(): Promise<TenantResponseDto[]> {
  return this.clientService.client.tenants.list();
}
```

3. Expose the `nblocks-tenants` path as an open endpoint allowing anonymous calls and restart your server
```json title=nblocks/config/resourceMappings.json
{
  ...
  "/nblocks-tenants": "ANONYMOUS",
  ...
}
```

3. Open up a new browser tab and enter `http://localhost:3000/nblocks-tenants` and voila! 👨🏻‍🍳   
You should see a list of your app tenants in JSON format.
