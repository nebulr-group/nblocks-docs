# Quickstart

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Overview

The following guide will get you up and running as quickly as possible by covering the following 3 steps:

1. Install the Nblocks plugins for both Backend and Frontend.
1. Run our provided scripts to bootstrap your project with an initial scaffolding and other dependencies. During this phase you'll be able to signup directly.
1. Testing the result and doing a small branding excercise üòâ

:::note

This quickstart requires you to have `npm` installed.

:::

Lets go! üöÄ

## Getting Started
In this exercise we'll install **Nblocks** for both a frontent and a backend project to leverage the full plug-n-play experience and prebaked feature set.
At this moment we support Ionic Angular for the frontent project and NestJS for the backend.

### Backend
Start with installing the backend! Install our plugin containing the necessary endpoints to power the Nblocks loaded frontend.

During the backend setup; the scripts will let you choose to signup for your own app profile in the Nblocks world.

:::tip Don't have a project yet?

If you don't have a project yet you can create a new skeleton project for NestJS.   
`nest new my-backend`. Requires @nestjs/cli.

Or you can clone a working [example project](https://github.com/nebulr-group/nblocks-nestjs-example) with this plugin installed from our Github üòâ

:::note

We support both NestJS 7 & 8.

:::

1. Step into your NestJS project root and run the scaffolding script to install our nblocks-nestjs plugin and all it's dependencies..
```bash
npx @nebulr-group/nblocks-plugin-tool setup-nestjs
```

2. Import the NBlocksModule in your app.module.ts
```typescript title="src/app.module.ts"
...
// Import the NBlocksModule
import { NBlocksModule } from '@nebulr-group/nblocks-nestjs';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ...
    // Add the NBlocksModule in module imports 
    NBlocksModule
    ...
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

3. Enable CORS in your main.ts since the Frontend project will need that to query data.
```typescript title="src/main.ts"
...
async function bootstrap() {
  ...
  // Enable CORS Add this to enable CORS
  app.enableCors();
  ...
  await app.listen(3000);
}
...
```

4. Launch your Backend. 
```bash
npm run start:dev
``` 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Frontend
It's time for the Nblocks plugin to supercharge your frontend.
:::tip Don't have a project yet?

If you don't have a project yet you can create a new skeleton project for Ionic.   
`ionic start my-frontend blank --type=angular`. Requires @ionic/cli to be installed.

Or you can clone a working [example project](https://github.com/nebulr-group/nblocks-ionic-example) with this plugin installed from our Github üòâ
:::
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ionic" label="Ionic" default>

:::note

We support Ionic 5 & 6 and Angular 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

:::

1. Step into your Ionic project root and run the scaffolding script to install our nblocks-ionic plugin and all it's dependencies.
```bash
npx @nebulr-group/nblocks-plugin-tool setup-ionic
```

2. Include the Nblocks css styles and styles from PrimeNG peer dependencies under **app > architect > build > options** in the angular.json file located in your project root.
Usually this property sits around row 34.
```json title="angular.json"
...
"styles": [
  ...
  // Add these four lines after your current styles imports
  "node_modules/primeicons/primeicons.css",
  "node_modules/primeng/resources/themes/saga-blue/theme.css",
  "node_modules/primeng/resources/primeng.min.css",
  "node_modules/@nebulr-group/nblocks-ionic/styles/global.css"
],
...
```

3. Import the NblocksIonicModule in your app.module.ts.
```typescript title="src/app/app.module.ts"
...
// Import the NblocksIonicModule and interceptor providers
import { NblocksIonicModule, NBLOCKS_AUTH_HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from '@nebulr-group/nblocks-ionic';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  entryComponents: [],
  imports: [
    ...
    // Add the NblocksIonicModule in module imports 
    NblocksIonicModule.forRoot({})
  ],
  providers: [
    ...
    // Add our interceptor providers to your current list of providers
    NBLOCKS_AUTH_HTTP_INTERCEPTORS
  ]
})
```

4. Launch your Frontend. 
```bash
ionic serve
``` 
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Done! Everything is installed and set!

You are now set up, supercharged and ready to power your app with all that we have to offer. Enjoy prebuilt frontend views and full functionality for:

-> Tenancy   
-> Register & onboarding   
-> Login   
-> Access control   
-> User management   
-> Checkout and billing   

## Let's try it!

### Create your first user and login
1. Go to your signup screen by clicking this link [http://localhost:8100/setup/signup](http://localhost:8100/setup/signup).
1. Signup with a new user.
1. Go to your email inbox, wait for the onboarding email to arrive and follow the instructions to set a password.
1. Login with your new credentials.
1. You're now logged in and your session is kept between page reloads, congrats!

  src={require('./assets/login.png').default}
  alt="Login screen"
  className="screenshot"
/>

**Here's a list of the build in views included in the frontend.**
- [http://localhost:8100/auth/login](http://localhost:8100/auth/login)
- [http://localhost:8100/auth/set-password](http://localhost:8100/auth/set-password)
- [http://localhost:8100/auth/onboarding](http://localhost:8100/auth/onboarding)
- [http://localhost:8100/auth/social-login](http://localhost:8100/auth/social-login)
- [http://localhost:8100/auth/mfa](http://localhost:8100/auth/mfa)
- [http://localhost:8100/user/list](http://localhost:8100/user/list)

### Try adding a second user
No fun without some friends ü§ô. You're going to use our user management view to add another user!

**Let's proceed!** üë®‚Äçüíª

1. If you're not logged in, login again.
1. Navigate your browser to `/user/list` as in [http://localhost:8100/user/list](http://localhost:8100/user/list) to see the User management screen.
<img
  src={require('./assets/user-list.png').default}
  alt="User list"
  className=""
/>
1. Click add user, enter an alternative email address to yourself and click invite.
1. Check your inbox for a new onboarding email and click the link to start and complete the onboarding process. 
(This is going to take you through the same step you just did yourself in the previous excercise.)
1. Login with your new user.
1. Navigate to [http://localhost:8100/user/list](http://localhost:8100/user/list) and you should se both your users popping up.


**Mission completed!** ü•ä

### That's all for today folks!
Great job with the quickstart! Now your app has been supercharged with Nblocks üöÄ and we got so much to show you what's under the hood.
You've just unlocked the next level and you're ready take on another challenge.

## Next steps
- Apply your simple and [first branding](examples/first-branding).
- Try another example and [query your first data with graphql](examples/graphql-playground).
- Create your first [controller](examples/querying-first-data).
- Read more about what's possible with [custom branding](fundamentals/branding.mdx).
- Get ready and [secure your app](fundamentals/security.mdx).
- Understand the concept of [Tenants and Users](fundamentals/tenants-users.mdx).
