# Tune in for B2C

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

In the Business-to-Consumer world, your users might expect a different and a little bit easier login and onboarding process than Business-to-Business (B2B). 
Let us walk you through how this can be customized with an example.

## Built in onboarding
When a new user logs in, Nblocks will ask this user for some personal information like name and phone number.
This information collected is later provided to your app in the user details for every request made.

<img
  src={require('../assets/onboarding.png').default}
  alt="Branding"
  className=""
/>

### Configuring
Let's configure to not use the built in onboarding because it's not relevant to have names on the individual users in this case. 
We're disabling this feature on the UI plugin.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ionic" label="Ionic" default>

Rember that NblocksIonicModule you imported during installation? Like we saw in the quickstart the module can take config parameters. This time we'll make use of the `onboarding` configuration and we're disableing it all together.

```typescript title="src/app/app.module.ts"

@NgModule({
  ...
    NblocksIonicModule.forRoot(
    {
      onboarding: {
        enabled: false, <--- We set enable to false.
        requiredFields: {
          firstName: false, <--- Invididual fields can be required or not if we should enable the view
          lastName: false, 
          phoneNumber: false
        }
      }
    }
  )
})
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### See the result
Try adding a new user, click the onboarding link sent to that users email address. 
After logging in in the first time you should come straight to the app and not see the built in onboarding any more.
