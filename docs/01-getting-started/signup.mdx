# Sign up for nblocks

## Sign up via Nblocks Admin
Click [here](https://auth.nblocks.cloud/url/signup/606b3215efbe6b0008aee09d) to sign up for a new account.

Once you have logged in to your new account you will be able to create your first Nblocks App. 
Use the API key and the App ID to start calling our APIs.

## Sign up through terminal
Sign up for Nblocks using our interactive terminal tool. The following command will create a new Nblocks app and also sign up with access to Nblocks Admin

```console
npx @nebulr-group/nblocks-cli create-app
```

The NPX tool will ask for an app name and your email address and then create a new folder and place a `.env` file containing your Nblocks API key and download a copy of your app profile into a file `app-configuration.json`.
Use this API key from the env file and the App ID from your app profile to start calling our APIs.
