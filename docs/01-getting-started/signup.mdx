# Signup for Nblocks
This page is in progress.
## Signup through terminal
Signup for Nblocks using our interactive terminal tool. Run the following command:
```console
npx @nebulr-group/nblocks-cli create-app
```

The NPX tool will create a new folder and place a `.env` file containing your Nblocks API key and download a copy of your app profile into a file `app-configuration.json`.
Use this API key from the env file and the App ID from your app profile to start calling our APIs.
