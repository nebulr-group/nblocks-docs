# Customers & Stripe

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

We've made it easy to setup a paywall to your app and offer new customers to pick a plan and checkout a new subscription that grants access to your app.
With this module we also have you covered from customers that stop paying. Users of these tenants will be locked out if they neglect the Nblocks reminders.
How you get paid by your customers is defined by your Business model which essentially consists of your `plans` and `tax` configurations.

We use Stripe as our payment partner.
The business model can be setup using the Nblock Dashboard or programmatically.

:::tip

## Plans
With plans you describe different subscription types that customers will be able to subscribe to. 
Naturally, different plans set out how rich feature set your app will provide. The richer feature set, the higher pricing.

For example consider you want to offer your app in two pricing points with different feature sets. One essential feature set and one complete. 
For that we define two plans.

| Name          | Description
| -----------   | -----------   |
| ESSENTIAL     | A light set of features that people can subscribe to |
| COMPLETE      | A bigger set of features that people can subscribe to |

:::note
Every time a customer (may it be a new or an existing one) checkout a new subscription; a new tenant with this plan is created. 
You're app will be able to easily obtain the plan information every time a request to your backend is made. 
Using that information you'll be able to provision different feature sets
:::

Once we've defined the different types of plans it's time to think of the pricing.

### Prices
Each plan will be tied to one or more pricings. The sole purpose for this is to make the plan available for different regions and currencies.

Consider you want to offer the "essential" plan for 50 Euros in France and 30 GBP in England.

| Region      | Price    | Currency |
| -----------   | -----------   | -----------   |
| FR     | 50 | EUR  |
| EN      | 30 | GBP   |

And the "complete" plan for 150 Euros in France and 100 GBP in England.

| Region      | Price    | Currency |
| -----------   | -----------   | -----------   |
| FR     | 150 | EUR  |
| EN      | 100 | GBP   |

These prices will be withdrawn monthly from your customers credit cards. 

Great! Now we know the plans and their pricings for different regions. Last but not least is to have a look at taxes.

## Taxes
Many businesses are obligated to collect Value added tax (VAT) from their domestic customers. This may vary if you have international customers. 
With that in mind we've done it easy to apply taxes like this for the regions you decide.

Let's say we're a French startup and we'd like our French customers to get a VAT of 20 % added to the total whilst having our English customers proceed without affecting the total.
We therefore declare these taxes:

| Region      | Name    | Percentage |
| -----------   | -----------   | -----------   |
| FR     | VAT/TVA | 20  |

## Checkout
We offer a pre built checkout solution that you can easily embed on your own product web page. 
The checkout allows new customers to subscribe to a plan with their credit card that automatically creates a new tenant workspace and user access to your application.

## Setup
Now when we understand the different parts of the business model we can set this up programmatically for our Nblocks app model.
1. You must first register for a Stripe account. This can be easily done at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com).
1. Add the Nblocks webhook URL to Stripe webhooks
1. Provide your Stripe api credentials (found in your Stripe dashboard) to Nblocks. Nblocks will use this to authenticate itself.
1. Then we update the business model which will synchronize automatically with Stripe creating the necessary resources in Stripe.
1. In the last example we use the checkout api to obtain a checkout id to use with Stripes official frontend library to open the prebuilt checkout view.

                ]
            }
        ]
    }
});
```

:::tip
Altering the business model will trigger a synchronization with Stripe. You must have stored your Stripe integration keys in Nblocks for this to happen.
:::

:::warning
Don't change products and price data inside Stripe created automatically by Nblocks. This might affect the checkout availability and recurring subscription management.

### Obtain an id for the prebuild Stripe checkout

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nestjs" label="NestJS" default>

```typescript
constructor(
    private readonly clientService: ClientService
  ) {}
...
const checkoutSession = await client.createCheckoutSession({plan: "ESSENTIAL", region: "FR"});

// Use checkoutSession.id to render the prebuilt Stripe checkout page using Stripe JS Lib.
```
