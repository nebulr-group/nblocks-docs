If you cannot find your stack in the example code you need to integrate this part manually.

Nblocks can be integrated with any stack or framework. Essentially it's all about REST API calls or redirecting the user browser agent which is documented in more details in the API reference [API reference](https://nebulr-group.github.io/nblocks-api-docs).

Use the other code examples to understand what should to be done and in what order.

We'd be happy to get feedback so we can add more code examples so don't forget to make a request, by joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kjWYdZ6f6G) and spell it out.
