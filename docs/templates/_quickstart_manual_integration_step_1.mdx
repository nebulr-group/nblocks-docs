## Step 1: Redirect users to Nblocks login

### Add a redirect action
Open your project source code in an editor of your choice. 
Then add an action in your app that will redirect the user to the Nblocks "Login" endpoint at `https://auth.nblocks.cloud/url/login/APP_ID` where `APP_ID` is your known app id.

A good practice is to add a new app route `/login` that triggers this action, so that when you navigate to `http://localhost:8080/login` the redirect is performed. Routing is a common concept and available for most frameworks.
