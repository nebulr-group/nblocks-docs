## Step 2: Receive the user back to your app
When the user completes authentication with Nblocks Login, the user is redirected back to your app with a code token that we will resolve into something more useful.
The URL containing the code token will look like this: `http://localhost:8080/auth/oauth-callback?code=XXXXXX....`

### Add a callback route and use the code to exchange for user tokens
Add a new route `/auth/oauth-callback` in your app that will act as a handler when the user is returned. In this handler you should retrieve the code token from the URL mentioned above and save it.

Then we will exchange this code token for more useful user profile information. 
Your app should make an API call to the Nblocks "Token" endpoint at `https://auth.nblocks.cloud/token/code/APP_ID` where `APP_ID` is your known app id in order to make this exchange.
The returning response contains secure token data in JWT format that we'll verify cryptographically usign public keys.

:::tip Decoding and verifying JWTs

JWTs is a well known concept in security. That means there are plenty of libraries for many software stacks to decode and verify them into readable JSON. Here's a extensive [list](https://jwt.io/libraries) of different libraries.
We'll be using one of these in our code examples.
