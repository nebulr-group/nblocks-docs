# FAQ

## Can I have several apps in Nblocks?
Yes of course! It's common to create an app for each environment of your project. Let's say you're hosting a SaaS CRM product. You'll then have one Nblocks app for production and one for the stage environment. Therefore you'll be able to enable and try out Nblocks features without interfering with real users before things are tested properly.

You might also not just have several environments but several projects that you use Nblocks with.

## Will you add a Nblocks plugin for Framework X?
We'd love to hear about these kinds of requests and what you'd like to see us take on next with Nblocks. Ping us at hello@nblocks.dev.
