# i18n & Translations

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

Internationalisation (i18n) support is a given requirement for any serious app project.
The Nblocks platform uses i18n to generate onboarding content and other communication material in different languages for your users.
What default language to use is determined by the `locale` property of your tenants. This is something you (programmatically) or the tenant owner can change anytime.

:::note

See [supported languages](#supported-languages-in-nblocks-platform) to understand the possibility and limitation of new languages.

:::

## Backend

Any request that has been authorized through Nblocks will contain the tenant context and ultimately a `locale` property.
You can use this property to set the language of the i18n plugin and render your own translations.

Since our backend plugins do not use translations we don't provide any examples. Feel free to use any tool you like.

## Supported languages in Nblocks platform

Even if you're supporting different languages in your app, the Nblocks platform (responsible for emailing, onboarding etc.) supports these languages at the time.
Nblocks will fallback to English if an unknown language is present.

| ISO_639-1 | Language                          |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| en        | English (Default for new tenants) |
| sv        | Swedish                           |

Contact us if you want to request support for a new language. We'd be happy to put that into the roadmap.
