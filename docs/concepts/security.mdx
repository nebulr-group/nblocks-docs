# Securing your app
Security is essential for any project and we want it to be as easy as possible for you to customize nBlocks to your security model.
The security model relates to the concept of users and tenants. If you wish to read about that before click [here](/docs/concepts/tenants-users).

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Define your roles
Your app model lets you define the different types of roles your users can adapt. 
Each role you define can grant one of many privileges, think of roles like a way of grouping privileges. 
The names of these are totally up to you and how you organize and protect the data in your app.
It's ultimately the match between the granted and required privilege that gets checked during authorization.

Good examples of roles: `OWNER`, `ADMIN`, `MANAGER` etc.

Good examples of privileges: `USER_READ`, `USER_WRITE`, `ENTITY_READ` etc.

:::note

Nblocks assigns the `OWNER` role to the person that initiated the creation of a [tenant](/docs/concepts/tenants-users). That person will be the first user and the responsible owner of that tenant.

:::

**Example**
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nestjs" label="NestJS" default>

```typescript
constructor(
    private readonly nebulrAuthService: NebulrAuthService,  <--- Inject the NebulrAuthService
    private readonly clientService: ClientService           <--- Inject the ClientService
  ) {}
...
const client = this.clientService.client; <--- Inject the Get the client instance

// Set role configuration
await client.updateApp({
    roles: [
        "OWNER": [
            "USER_READ",
            "USER_WRITE",
        ],
        "ADMIN": [
            "USER_READ",
            "USER_WRITE",
        ],
        "MANAGER": [
            "USER_READ"
        ]
    ]
});

// Change the role for the current user
const currentUser = this.nebulrAuthService.getCurrentUser();
const userClient = client.tenant(currentUser.tenant.id).user(currentUser.id);
await userClient.update({role: "MANAGER"});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Restricting backend endpoints
When users login, Nblocks will automatically grant their set of privileges depending on their role.

The `resourceMappings.json` is the heart of the RBAC configuration. It supports both GraphQL queries/mutations as well as HTTP requests. You can use wildcards to allow or disallow a whole controller or route. Here's how one could look.

:::tip What is RBAC?
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a mechanism that restricts system access. The user will gain access to certain parts of the system depending on which roll and what privileges the user have. If you want to read more about RBAC is on Wikipedia, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control).
:::

```json title=nblocks/config/resourceMappings.json
{
    "graphql/readCase":"CASE_READ",
    "graphql/createCase":"CASE_WRITE",
    "/secret": "SECRET_READ",
    "/**": "ANONYMOUS"
}
```

Above configuration will demand authenticated users to have the privilege `CASE_READ` when calling the GraphQL query `readCase` and `SECRET_READ` when calling `HTTP GET|PUT|POST /secret`. Any HTTP call to any other controller action (/\*\*) will be treated as an anonymous call.

In the quick start part the script did just configure all endpoints to allow `ANONYMOUS` calls meaning the built in gatekeeping will not activate any authentication nor resource authorization. To activate gatekeeping, try to change the privileges to `USER_READ`. This will have all calls that are missing auth context to render back `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`. If you're already using any of our NBlocks UI plugins, you'll be redirected to the login screen immediately after making such a request.

If you wish to do your own role check in your own code you'll always have access to the role data of the `currentUser` data via `NebulrAuthService.getCurrentUser()`.

## Security data is always available
Each request made from a logged in user always contains resolved security data. You can use this data build filters, data separation, audit logs etc.
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nestjs" label="NestJS" default>

```typescript
constructor(
    private readonly nebulrAuthService: NebulrAuthService <--- Inject the NebulrAuthService
  ) {}

const currentUser = this.nebulrAuthService.getCurrentUser();

// Content of currentUser
{
    "id": "605b603cfeb",
    "role": "MANAGER",
    "email": "john@doe.com",
    "username": "john@doe.com",
    "fullName": "John Doe",
    "onboarded": true,
    "tenant": {
      "id": "605b603cf",
      "name": "Monsters Inc",
      "locale": "en"
    }
  }
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Password complexity
Initially password validation is disabled when running the plugin in `devMode` for a smooth quick start. This can easily be enabled by providing the configuration to the Nblocks UI plugin.
The default validation requires the following complexity:
- Password field can not be empty.
- Minimal length: 10 characters.
- Should contain uppercase letter.
- Should contain lowercase letter.
- Should contain digit.
- Should contain special character.

You can also change the complexity by providing your own Regex which will be used instead.

Here are some examples how to change the plugin config.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="react" label="React" default>

** Enable password validation **
```typescript
<NblocksProvider config={{passwordValidation: true}}>
  ...
</NblocksProvider>
```

** Bring your own password Regex **
```typescript
<NblocksProvider config={{passwordValidation: true, passwordComplexityRegex: /^(?=.*[A-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[$@])(?!.*[iIoO])\S{6,12}$/ }}>
  ...
</NblocksProvider>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
