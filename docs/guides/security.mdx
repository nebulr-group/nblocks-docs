# Securing your app
Security is essential for any project and we want it to be as easy as possible for you to customize nBlocks to your security model.

## Define your roles
Your app model lets you define the different types of roles your users can adapt. 
Each role you define can grant one of many privilegues, think of roles like a way of grouping privilegues. 
The names of these are totally up to you and how you organize and protect the data in your app.
It's ultimatly the match between the granted and required privilegue that gets checked during authorization.

Good examples of roles: `OWNER`, `ADMIN`, `MANAGER` etc.

Good examples of privilegues: `USER_READ`, `USER_WRITE`, `ENTITY_READ` etc.

:::note

nBlocks assigns the `OWNER` role to the person that iniated the creation of a tenant. That person will be the first user and the responsible owner of that tenant.

**Example**
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nestjs" label="NestJS" default>

```typescript
constructor(
    private readonly nebulrAuthService: NebulrAuthService,
    private readonly clientService: ClientService
  ) {}
...
# Get the client instance
const client = this.clientService.client;

# Set role configuration
await client.updateApp({
    roles: [
        "OWNER": [
            "USER_READ",
            "USER_WRITE",
        ],
        "ADMIN": [
            "USER_READ",
            "USER_WRITE",
        ],
        "MANAGER": [
            "USER_READ"
        ]
    ]
});

# Change the role for the current user
const currentUser = this.nebulrAuthService.getCurrentUser();
const userClient = client.tenant(currentUser.tenant.id).user(currentUser.id);
await userClient.update({role: "MANAGER"});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="expressjs" label="Express.js">
Coming soon...
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Restricting backend endpoints
When users login NBlocks will automatically grant their set of privilegues depending to their role.

The `resourceMappings.json` is the heart of the RBAC configuration. It supports both GraphQL queries/mutations as well as HTTP requests. You can use wildcards to allow or dissallow a whole controller or route. Here's how one could look.

```json title=nblocks/config/resourceMappings.json
{
    "graphql/readCase":"CASE_READ",
    "graphql/createCase":"CASE_WRITE",
    "/secret": "SECRET_READ",
    "/**": "ANONYMOUS"
}
```

Above configuration will demand authenticated users to have the privilegue `CASE_READ` when calling the GraphQL query `readCase` and `SECRET_READ` when calling `HTTP GET|PUT|POST /secret`. Any HTTP call to any other controller action (/\*\*) will be treated as an anonymous call.

In the quick start part the script did just configure all endpoints to allow `ANONYMOUS` calls meaning the built in gatekeeping will not activate any authentication nor resource authorization. To activate gatekeeping, try to change the privilegues to `USER_READ`. This will have all calls that are missing auth cotext to render back `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`. If you're already using any of our NBlocks UI plugins, you'll be redirected to the login screen immediately after making such request.

If you wish to do your own role check in your own code you'll always have access to the role data of the currentUser data via `NebulrAuthService`.
