# Login providers
nBlocks supports third party login providers and you can start using them to authenticate your users today. 
Even though each provider has their own process to generate an OAuth application the overall flow looks pretty much the same.

For a solid brand experience from your users you need to generate the OAuth credentials yourself. 
During this credential generation process with the provider it will be possible to set your own app name and logo so users feel safe and trust the message.

As a last step you'll be storing these credentials on your app model and nBlocks will use them and take care of the rest. 
We'll always ask for as little information as possible from the provider to safely authenticate the user and never use the information to anything else.

:::note

A user must have been invited to a tenant before attepting to login with a provider.

To use OAuth 2.0 in your application, you need an OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret, which your application uses when requesting an OAuth 2.0 access token.

To create an OAuth 2.0 client ID in the console:
1. Go to the Google Cloud Platform Console.
1. From the projects list, select a project. Or create a new one
1. If the APIs & services page isn't already open, open the console left side menu and select APIs & services.
1. On the left, click Credentials.
1. Click Create Credentials, then select OAuth client ID.
1. Select the appropriate application type for your project and enter any additional information required.
1. When you use OAuth 2.0 for authentication, your users are authenticated after they agree to terms that are presented to them on a user consent screen.  If this is your first time creating a client ID, you can also configure your consent screen by clicking Consent Screen. You won't be prompted to configure the consent screen after you do it the first time. To set up your project's consent screen:
    1. Go to the Google API Console OAuth consent screen page. Add required information like a product name and support email address.
    1. Click Add Scope.
    1. On the dialog that appears, select the scopes your project uses. Sensitive scopes display a lock icon next to the API name.
        1. To be able to fetch user email, you need to enable the People API, from APIs & Services > API Library.
        1. When you're finished adding details to the OAuth consent screen, click Submit for verification.
1. Go back to Credentials screen and click edit required application.
1. Save provided Client Secret and Client ID.
