# SDK client

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The SDK client is our swiss army knife for querying the Nblocks Rest API directly and most of our plug-n-play experiences use the SDK client under the hood to deliver their feature set. 
It comes with typings and documentation built in for your convenience.

You'll be able to get hold of a client instance straight, all prepped with credentials, from your plug-n-play plugin.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nestjs" label="NestJS" default>

```typescript
constructor(
    private readonly clientService: ClientService <--- Inject the ClientService
  ) {}
...
const client = this.clientService.client; <--- Get the client instance

await client.tenants.list(); <--- Use the client instance for something
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Reference
The SDK client wraps all functionality from the Nblocks Rest API. See our [API Reference](https://nebulr-group.github.io/nblocks-api-docs) for exact usage.

## Deep dive
The client and its sub clients are organised around the Nblocks feature areas and to be a smooth experience for developers using it. 

A client hierarchy has been setup to allow chaining calls.
```
PlatformClient
│── AuthClient
│── CommunicationClient
│── Tenants (generic client)
└───Tenant (specific client)
    │── FileClient
    │── Users (generic client)
    └───User (specific client)
```

* Generic clients lets you do operations on a group of instances that doesn't require a certain id to be present. E.g. `create`, `list` etc.
* Specific clients lets you do operations on a specific instance that require a certain id to be present. E.g. `get`, `update`, `delete`, `sendEmail` etc.

This allowed us to accomplish the following experience for our developers.

```javascript
const client = new PlatformClient("ACCESS_KEY");

const aBunchOfUsers = await client.tenant(user.tenant.id).users.list();

const user = client.auth.authorize(authToken, userId, "secure/endpoint");

await client.tenant(user.tenant.id).user(user.id).sendSms({text: "Hello you"});
```

## Quick start
You can install the SDK client manually and use it directly if non of our plug-n-play experiences suite your needs.
1. Install the plugin
```
npm i @nebulr-group/nblocks-ts-client
```

2. Import the PlatformClient from the package
```javascript
import { PlatformClient } from '@nebulr-group/nblocks-ts-client'
```

3. Instantiate a new client with your access token.
```javascript
const client = new PlatformClient("ACCESS_KEY");
```

4. List all tenants in your app and write the result to your console
```javascript
import { Tenant } from '@nebulr-group/nblocks-ts-client'

const tenants:Tenant[] = await client.tenants.list();
tenants.map(t: Tenant => console.log(`Name: ${t.name}, ID:${t.id}`));
```

**Success!**
