# Getting payment ready

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

We've made it easy to setup a paywall to your app and offer new customers to pick a plan and checkout a new subscription that grants access to your app.
How you get paid by your customers is defined by your pricing plan which essentially consists of your *plans* configuration set.

We use Stripe as our payment partner.
Your pricing plan can easily be setup programmatically, we'll go through this later.

We also have you covered from customers that stop paying. Users of these tenants will be locked out if they neglect the Nblocks reminders.

In this guide we'll setup an integration with Stripe in no time. The integration will initially run Stripe in test mode for the sake of having you click through the functionalty.
We'll end up describing how you can toggle the integration into production mode.

## Setup the Stripe integration
First step is to create your own Stripe account which NBlocks is going to use to enable payments.
1. Register for a new Stripe account. This can be easily done at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com). If you already have an account you can use that.
<img
  src={require('../assets/stripe/stripe_1.png').default}
  alt="Create stripe account"
  className=""
/>
1. Theres no need to activate payments and setup banking at this point.
1. Give your account a name which is required by Stripe before we can test payments.
<img
  src={require('../assets/stripe/stripe_2.png').default}
  alt="Set account name"
  className=""
/>
1. Grab your Stripe test keys (both Publishable key and Secret key) found in your Stripe dashboard or at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys. It's important these keys are for the test mode, otherwise you'll not be able to use Stripes test credit cards during checkout.
<img
  src={require('../assets/stripe/stripe_3.png').default}
  alt="Set account name"
  className=""
/>
1. Go to your app config page [http://localhost:8080/setup/config](http://localhost:8080/setup/config) and add these keys. Nblocks will use this to authenticate itself for future payments.
1. Voila!

## Setup your pricing plan
Next step is to define some simple plans so there's actually something our users can checkout. We'll go ahead and explain the *Pricing plan* very briefly and how to setup a first draft. 

:::tip

For this example we're going to create two *plans*: one free named "FREE" and one paid named "PREMIUM".
Payments will be made in Euro and charged should recur monthly. These details needs to be put together into a JSON format and stored on your app model.

1. Head over to your backend project and locate the `app-configuration.json` file located in `nblocks/config` folder.
2. Change the `businessModel` property with below JSON directly within the file.
```json title="nblocks/config/app-configuration.json"
...
"businessModel": {
  "taxes": [],
  "plans": [
      {
          "name": "FREE",
          "prices": [
              {
                  "region": "DEFAULT",
                  "amount": 0,
                  "currency": "EUR",
                  "recurrenceInterval": "month"
              }
          ]
      },
      {
          "name": "PREMIUM",
          "prices": [
              {
                  "region": "DEFAULT",
                  "amount": 50,
                  "currency": "EUR",
                  "recurrenceInterval": "month"
              }
          ]
      }
  ]
},
...
```
3. In the terminal of your backend project; run `npx @nebulr-group/nblocks-plugin-tool push-app` to persist the changes.

## Restrict features
Both out frontend and backend plugins contain support to restrict user access to features and components based on the current plan. 
This is really useful when you want to just allow certain customers access to specific features.

In the below example we're going to restrict the analytics dashboard for any other than PREMIUM customers.
### Frontend

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="react" label="React" default>

#### Content

The *NBAccessControlComponent* let's you show content for certain plans or user roles.

```tsx
<NBAccessControlComponent plans={["PREMIUM"]}>
  {/** The children here will just be shown if the criteras are met */}
  <AnalyticsButton />
</NBAccessControlComponent>
```

#### Routes

The *NBPlanAccessControlGuard* let's you enable a route for certain plans. The guard will redirect the user back if the criteras are not met.

```tsx
<Route exact path="/analytics" element={
    <NBAccessControlGuard plans={['PREMIUM']}>
      {/** The Route children here will just be possible if the criteras are met otherwise a redirect will happen */}
      <Analytics />
    </NBAccessControlGuard>
  }
/>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Backend

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nestjs" label="NestJS" default>

Use the *resourceMappings.json* file to restrict a HTTP endpoint or GraphQL resolver to a certain plan. 
Here we say that the dashboard endpoint requires users to have plan PREMIUM and AUTHENTICATED privilege.

```json title="nblocks/config/resourceMappings.json"
...
"/analytics/data": {
  "privilege": "AUTHENTICATED",
  "plans": ["PREMIUM"]
},
...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Signup
The time has come to finally test payments. NBlocks supports two ways to expose this to your end users.
- Using the signup form in-app where the new user will be guided through a payment step after onboarding.
- Using a set of unique links to open the prebuilt checkout views which automatically create a new user.

:::tip
These alternatives and their links are available to explore on your app config page [http://localhost:8080/setup/config](http://localhost:8080/setup/config).
:::

We're going to make use of the first option this time.
1. Go to [http://localhost:8080/setup/signup](http://localhost:8080/setup/signup) and signup for a new account.
1. Click the link in signup email and login.
1. Select the PREMIUM plan.
1. Enter the Stripe test credit card `4242 4242 4242 4242`, valid until `12/34` and any CVC number.
1. Click subscribe.
1. Done! You're now a paying subscriber to your own app! Check that you can access Premium features

## Getting production ready
Getting production ready with Stripe is as easy as replacing the test keys with the live keys via the app config page. You can grab your Stripe live keys here https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.

:::note
You will not be able to use the Stripe test credit card during checkout in production mode.
