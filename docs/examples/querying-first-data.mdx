# Using the client to query your first data

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Intro
1. In this example, you'll code a small backend controller which will be responsible to render back a list of all your tenant workspaces.
1. We'll make use of the built in API client to query this data straight from the Nblocks platform.
1. You'll be testing this and see the result by using your web browser and navigating to [http://localhost:3000/nblocks-tenants](http://localhost:3000/nblocks-tenants).

:::tip
Curious about the API client and what it can do? Head over the [API client article](../articles/api-client).
:::

## Let's code!
Open up your backend project where our nblocks-backend plugin is installed.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nestjs" label="NestJS" default>

1. Open the up the AppController.ts and inject `ClientService` as a provider from our plugin.
```typescript title=src/app.controller.ts
import { ClientService, TenantResponseDto } from '@nebulr-group/nblocks-nestjs';
...
constructor(
    private readonly clientService: ClientService
  ) {}
```

2. Create a new controller action. Let's call it `nblocks-tenants`.
```typescript title=src/app.controller.ts
@Get('nblocks-tenants')
async nblocksTenants(): Promise<TenantResponseDto[]> {
  return this.clientService.client.tenants.list();
}
```

:::tip
`TenantResponseDto` response type is available to import from the plugin.
:::

3. Before we're done we need to make sure this new controller endpoint can actually be accessed by a browser and this is done in `resourceMappings.json`. 
Add a new line to delare that the `nblocks-tenants` path will allow anonymous calls.
```json title=nblocks/config/resourceMappings.json
{
  ...
  "/nblocks-tenants": "ANONYMOUS",
  ...
}
```
:::info
Changes to `resourceMappings.json` requires a server restart.
:::

3. That's all you needed to do. Restart the backend and head over to the result!

## Check the result
Open up a new browser tab and enter [http://localhost:3000/nblocks-tenants](http://localhost:3000/nblocks-tenants) and voila! üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥   
You should see a list of your app tenants in JSON format.
